- [x] Alpha-beta pruning
- [x] Dynamically decide what depth for alpha-beta based on number of snakes left alive
- [ ] Come up with a real heuristic function
	- Take hunger/food into account
- [ ] Consider snake heads separately from their bodies
- [ ] More sophisticated state update for moves
	- Hunger
- [ ] Implement BFS
